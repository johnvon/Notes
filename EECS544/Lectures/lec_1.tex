\section{Graph}
\begin{definition}
	A graph \(\mathcal{G}\) is a tuple of two sets, one is \emph{edge set} \(\mathcal{E}\) , another is \emph{vertex set} \(\mathcal{V}\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	For a node \(v\in\mathcal{V}\), the \emph{in-degree} of a node in a directed graph \(\mathcal{G}\) is defined as the number of edges pointing in to \(v\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	For a node \(v\in\mathcal{V}\), the \emph{out-degree} of a node in a directed graph \(\mathcal{G}\) is defined as the number of edges pointing out from \(v\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	An undirected graph is \emph{connected} if for every two nodes, there exists at least one path connect them together.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	A directed graph is \emph{strongly connected} if for every two nodes, there exists at least one path connect them together. Notice that the edges in a path now
	have direction.
\end{definition}
