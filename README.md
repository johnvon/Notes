# Lecture Notes @University of Michigan

## Abstract

This repo contains all lecture notes I took in Umich by $$\LaTeX$$ together with Inkscape. The `header.tex` is the same in [Academic Template](https://github.com/sleepymalc/Academic-Template), which can be freely adjusted in order to meet your own needs. The particular compile environment should be not that relvant, since the packages this notes environment depend on is quite straightforward and elegant, hence a simple `pdflatex` should do the job. As for Inkscape figures, please look into [VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape](https://github.com/sleepymalc/VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape) and also [inkscape-figures](https://github.com/sleepymalc/inkscape-figures) for detailed configuration. Feel free to submit pull requests if you find a typo and want to fix it.

## About Honor Code

According to the UM [Academic Rules, Rights and Responsibilities](https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/rules/),

> It is always required that ideas and materials obtained from another student or from any other source be acknowledged in one’s work. The latter is particularly important, because material is so freely available on the Internet. According to Merriam-Webster online dictionary, to plagiarize is “To steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one’s own.” To avoid plagiarism, it is necessary to cite all sources of both ideas and direct quotations, including those found on the Internet.

## Contribution
