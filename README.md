	The Source Code of my LaTeX Lecture Notes.

## Abstract

This repo contains all $\LaTeX$ source codes of the lecture notes I took in university. A more readable verison can be found [here](https://www.pbb.wtf/posts/Notes).

The [`header.tex`](https://github.com/sleepymalc/Academic-Template/blob/main/Notes/header.tex) can be found in [Academic Template](https://github.com/sleepymalc/Academic-Template), together with a simple, but complete [demo](https://github.com/sleepymalc/Academic-Template/tree/main/Notes/master.pdf).
> **You need to include this header to compile any of my notes!** The particular compile environment should be not that relevant since the packages this environment depends on are quite straightforward and minimal, hence a simple *pdflatex* should do the job. As for Inkscape figures, please look into [VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape](https://github.com/sleepymalc/VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape) for detailed configuration.

## About Honor Code

According to the UM [Academic Rules, Rights and Responsibilities](https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/rules/),

> It is always required that ideas and materials obtained from another student or from any other source be acknowledged in one’s work. The latter is particularly important, because material is so freely available on the Internet. According to Merriam-Webster online dictionary, to plagiarize is “To steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one’s own.” To avoid plagiarism, it is necessary to cite all sources of both ideas and direct quotations, including those found on the Internet.

## Contribution

The works are partially contributed by some other students, TAs, and professors in JI, which would be listed if known.
> If you find any problems in the repository, welcome to make an issue or pull request.
