\subsection{Operations on CW Complexes}
\subsubsection{Products}\label{CW-complex-product}
We can consider the product of two \hyperref[def:CW-Complex]{CW complex} given by a \hyperref[def:CW-Complex]{CW complex} structure. Namely, given \(X\) and \(Y\)
two \hyperref[def:CW-Complex]{CW complexes}, we can take two cells \(e^n_{\alpha }\) from \(X\) and \(e^m_{\beta }\) from \(Y\) and
form the product space \(e^n_{\alpha }\times e^m_{\beta }\), which is homeomorphic to an \((n+m)\)-cell. We then
take these products as the cells for \(X\times Y\).

Specifically, given \(X\), \(Y\) are \hyperref[def:CW-Complex]{CW complexes}, then \(X\times Y\) has a cell structure
\[
	\left\{e_{\alpha}^m \times e_{\alpha}^n\colon e^m_{\alpha}\text{ is a \(m\)-cell on \(X\)}, e^n_{\alpha}\text{ is an \(n\)-cell on \(Y\)}\right\}.
\]
\begin{remark}
	The product topology may not agree with the weak topology on the \(X\times Y\). However, they do agree if
	\(X\) or \(Y\) is locally compact \underline{or} if \(X\) and \(Y\) both have at most countably many cells.
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Wedge Sum}\label{CW-complex-wedge-sum}
Given \(X\), \(Y\) are \hyperref[def:CW-Complex]{CW complexes}, and \(x_0\in X^0\), \(y_0\in Y^0\) (only points). Then we define
\[
	X\vee Y = X\coprod Y
\]
with quotient topology.
\begin{remark}
	\(X\lor Y\) is a \hyperref[def:CW-Complex]{CW complex}.
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Quotients}\label{CW-complex-quotient}
Let \(X\) be a \hyperref[def:CW-Complex]{CW complex}, and \(A\subseteq X\) \hyperref[def:CW-subcomplex]{subcomplex} (closed union of cells), then
\[
	\quotient{X}{A}
\]
is a quotient space collapse \(A\) to one point and inherits a \hyperref[def:CW-Complex]{CW complex} structure.

\begin{remark}
	\(\quotient{X}{A} \) is a \hyperref[def:CW-Complex]{CW complex}.
\end{remark}
\(0\)-skeleton
\[
	(X^0 - A^0)\coprod \ast
\]
where \(\ast\) is a point for \(A\). Each cell of \(X-A\) is attached to \(\left(\quotient{X}{A} \right)^n\)
by attaching map
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		S^n \ar[r,"\phi_{\alpha}"] & X^n \ar[r, "\text{quotient}"] & \quotient{X^n}{A^n}
	\end{tikzcd}
\]

\begin{eg}
	Here is some interesting examples.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item We can take the sphere and squish the equator down to form a \hyperref[CW-complex-wedge-sum]{wedge} of two spheres.

		      \end{figure}
		\item We can take the torus and squish down a ring around the hole.

			      \caption{We see that \(\quotient{X}{A}\) is \hyperref[def:homotopy-equivalence]{homotopy equivalent}
				      to a \(2\)-sphere \hyperref[CW-complex-wedge-sum]{wedged} with a \(1\)-sphere via extending the red point into a line, and then
				      sliding the left point to the line along the \(2\)-sphere towards the other points, forming a circle.}
